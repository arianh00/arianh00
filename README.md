# Hey there!! 👋 <br> Thanks for cheking me out :D 

### Student at University of León and Coolest older brother 😎​

Hi, my name is Andrés Riaño Honrubia.

I have been in love with coding since I made my first __'Hellow World!'__ four years ago and I am eager to explore all the intricacies of this wonderful field of study.

I think improvement should be measured upon your past acomplishments and not upon some other people's. <br> Thus I aspire to be at least as good as the best version of myself.

## Hobbies / Cool things ​🎮​ ⚽

I also love sports and I am very passionate about videogames.

I currently play padel at an above amateur level and I also ski at semi-proffesional level.

I love roguelikes and metroidvanias. I am also fascinated by how much of a mark a game can leave on a person.

## People I Love and Owe lots to ❤️​
### My family ​🧔🏻‍♂️​👱🏻‍♀️​👦🏻​🧒🏻​👴🏻​🧓🏻​
  I literally wouldn´t be as I am today without their love and support.
### My friends 🤜🏻​🤛🏻​
  Specially those who have supported me even when no one else would.
### My tutor 👨🏼‍💻​
  I quite literally wouldn´t be half the dev without the countless tips and tricks this man has given me. <br> Not to mention the continuous encouragement he has given me.
